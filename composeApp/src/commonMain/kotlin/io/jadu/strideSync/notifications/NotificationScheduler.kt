 * Cross-platform notification scheduler.

 * Or obtain it inside a composable:
 * ```kotlin

 * Platform behaviour:
 * - **Android** — backed by WorkManager; survives app kill and battery optimisation.
 * - **iOS** — backed by `UNUserNotificationCenter`; requests authorisation on first use.
 * - **Desktop** — no-op stub (local notifications are not supported on JVM desktop).
